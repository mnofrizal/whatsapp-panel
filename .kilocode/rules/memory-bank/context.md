- **UI Components**: Custom components with Radix UI and Tailwind
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management with useCallback for performance
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router with protected routes

## Next Steps & Potential Enhancements

Based on the current implementation, potential areas for future development:

1. **Webhook Management**: Interface for configuring webhook endpoints
2. **API Key Management**: UI for managing API keys and tokens
3. **Automation Features**: The automation page structure exists but needs implementation
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: More detailed analytics and monitoring features
5. **Bulk Operations**: Managing multiple instances simultaneously
6. **Dashboard Socket.IO**: Extend Socket.IO integration to dashboard and instance list pages
7. **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**: Add link to the `SOCKET_IO_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file

## Development Environment

- **Port**: Application runs on port 3100 with Turbopack
- **API Backend**: Configured to connect to `http://localhost:3000` (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth configured with local credentials
- **Build System**: Standard Next.js build with Tailwind CSS

## Current Challenges & Considerations

1. **Backend Dependency**: Application requires external WhatsApp API service
2. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented; could be enhanced
3. **Testing**: No visible test suite in current implementation
4. **Socket.IO Server**: Requires Socket.IO server implementation on backend

## Project Maturity

The application is in a **production-ready state** for its core functionality, with a professional interface and complete feature set for WhatsApp instance management. The codebase shows good organization and follows Next.js best practices.
